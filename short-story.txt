Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True
Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa
constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.
[Boa] In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without
chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six
months that they need for digestion." I pondered deeply, then, over the
adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded
in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like
this: [Hat] I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the
drawing frightened them. But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be
frightened by a hat?" My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of
a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able
to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa
constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to
have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this: [Elephant inside
the boa] The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my
drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote
myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at
the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a
painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my
Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is
tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them. So
then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a
little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very
useful to me. At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost
in the night, such knowledge is valuable.
